        <pre>Opening</pre>
        <pre>
Hey boy, I'ma get ya
I'ma get you real good, and I bet ya (it's Megan Thee Stallion)
Hey boy, once I get ya
You'll be, oh, so glad that I met ya (and TWICE)
Ow!
        </pre>

        <pre>
Step one, do my highlight
Make me shine so bright in the moonlight
Step two, silhouette tight
Baby, even my shadow looks good, right?
Step three, when I arrive
Make you look my way with your heart eyes
Step four, got you on the floor
Make you say, "More, more, more"
        </pre>

        <pre>
When I say, "Hi"
I'm feeling all your attention on me
Hi, no reason to be so shy with me
I ain't gonna bite, come on over (no)
I know you wanna move a little closer (yeah)
I got a plan to get you with me
        </pre>

        <pre>
I got you on my radar, soon you're gonna be with me
My strategy, strategy, will get ya, get ya, baby
Winning is my trademark, soon you'll never wanna leave
My strategy, strategy, will get ya, get ya, baby
        </pre>

        <pre>
Hey boy, I'ma get ya
I'ma get you real good and I bet ya
Hey boy, once I get ya
You'll be, "Oh, so glad that I met ya"
        </pre>

        <pre>
You'll be, "Oh, so glad that I met ya"
When your cheeks go red? (That's cute)
"I wanna dance," you said (oh, cool)
'Til I'm in your heart (it's cruel)
And you can't forget
You're feeling things now, and you're confused
Watching my body getting loose
You don't know what you're gonna do
You're mine
        </pre>

        <pre>
When I say, "Hi"
I'm feeling all your attention on me
Hi, no reason to be so shy with me
I ain't gonna bite, come on over (no)
I know you wanna move a little closer (yeah)
I got a plan to get you with me
        </pre>

        <pre>
I got you on my radar, soon you're gonna be with me
My strategy, strategy, will get ya, get ya, baby
Winning is my trademark, soon you'll never wanna leave
My strategy, strategy, will get ya, get ya, baby (real hot girl, shh)

Do you like that? (Huh?)
When I smack it, and you watch it bounce it right back?
He really lost it when he saw me do the right, left (hmm)
I'm a man eater, you are just a light snack (baow)
I got him pressed like he's workin' on his triceps (hmm)
I'ma flirt, I'ma tease, they be hurt after me
Told him, "Baby, what's a player to the G-A-M-E?"
Sand need to worry 'bout him bringing me to the beach
Jealous? Who? Girl, please
        </pre>

        <pre>
Left, right, left, right, do it to the beat (do it to the beat)
Talk with my body, that's my strategy (baow, baow)
Other girls tryin' but I'm really hard to beat
He'll be mine off my strategy (yeah, yeah)
Left, right, left, right, do it to the beat (do it to the beat)
Talk with my body, that's my strategy (baow, baow)
Other girls tryin' but I'm really hard to beat
He'll be mine off my strategy (yeah, yeah)
        </pre>

        <pre>
My strategy, strategy, like gravity, gravity
One look at me, look at me
I bet ya, bet ya, bet ya, boy
You'll be down on your knees
Calling me up, begging me "Don't leave"
My strategy, strategy
Will get ya, get ya, get ya, boy (ow!)
        </pre>

        <pre>
Will get ya, get ya, get ya, boy (ow!)
Hey boy, I'ma get ya
I'ma get you real good, and I bet ya (real good and I bet ya)
Hey boy, once I get ya
You'll be, oh, so glad that I met ya (oh, so glad that I, ooh)
Hey boy, I'ma get ya (hey, boy, yeah)
I'ma get you real good, and I bet ya (good and I bet ya)
Hey boy, once I get ya (hey, boy)
You'll be, oh, so glad that I met ya (oh, so glad that I met ya)
        </pre>

        <pre>
Hey boy, I'ma get ya
I'ma get you real good and I bet ya
